What is blood and betrayal? It is our attempt at making a ttrpg with martial
characters in mind. We think wizards and archers and priests are cool, but
gameplay for martial characters boils down to "Hit hard". Some games do this
better, others worse, but it is rare for the fighter to feel fun to play.

What could be interesting choices, such as weapons, get distilled to different
damage dice, or different situational advantages. 

We want Blood and Betrayal to do more than that. We want weapons to feel like a
strong choice, with good and bad match ups. We want the run in between a spear
fighter and a sword user to be different than a pugalist and a grappler going
at it.

We have chosen ancient Rome as our setting. We picture the players as a band of
gladiators in the twilight of the republic, witnessing incredible events, but
not being the movers and shakers. 

We have the following objectives for design:

## Dramatic
We want drama. Playing blood and betrayal should feel like making characters
for a greek myth. Even roman senators are weary of the fates. 

## Calculated
We want combat to feel like a calculated risk. What makes it fun is feeling
like you made the correct decison and weighted the risk and consequences well.

## Historic
We want characters to feel the flow of time. A campaign is from cradle to
grave. A highly skilled gladiatior will only see 30 fights in their whole life.
