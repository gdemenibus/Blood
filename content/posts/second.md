# How to Grapple?

Grappling has a bit of stigma in fantasy tabletop as being complicated, and
most of the time, really not worth it. Its use gets quickly outpaced by spells
and other means of trapping opponents. It does not scale to multiple opponents.

Some builds manage to break it, and abuse it to keep foes pinned while the rest
of the gang literally kicks them when they are down.

For us, grappling is important, and a core way to play the game. When Gilgamesh
fought Enkidu, he did so by wrestling him. Wrestling is all over the ancient
world, and was practiced to some extent by gladiators.

However, wrestling should feel unique. Fighting a wrestler and a striker should
be different expiriences. Grappling has a slightly different win condition than striking: Choking the
opponent out should result in a win. 

The design we have narrowed down on is: grappling as the anti armour build.
Grappling does pure damage, and is not reduced by armour.  It is a risky
approach, but with great payoff.

From this, we created the grappling round. This is a round of combat with no
direction, where only grappling moves may be used.

## Active vs Passive defence
Inspired by MCDM, we beleive passive defence can be slightly boring. Our armor
system is passive during combat, but wearing different equipment may have a big
impact on your surivability, and resilience. 

Protecting from a grapple should be an active choice. If an adversary knows you
are a grappler, it should be harder pull of a grapple. 

As such, we introduce a set up move/ stance that makes you immune to grappling
for that round. This means defending against a grappler always comes at a cost,
and is something players need to think about.

## Actor vs Subject
We destinguish between acotr and subject. The actor is the champion that
successfully initialized the grapple. The Subject is the one getting grappled.
Some actions are only available to on of the two

##  Potential actions:
Reverse grapple
Trash (Subject)
Lock up()
Choke(Actor)
